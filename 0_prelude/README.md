# Prelude to HTTP

## Introduction

Before diving into HTTP, it's essential to understand the basics of how data is transmitted over a network. This section provides a foundational overview of network communication, focusing on the use of sockets, which are crucial for HTTP and other protocols.

## Sockets and Their Importance

Sockets are endpoints for sending and receiving data across a network. They are used by applications to communicate over a network, utilizing protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Understanding sockets is fundamental to implementing and troubleshooting HTTP servers and clients.

## Simple Socket

The simplest form of a socket example, demonstrating basic socket creation, binding, listening, and accepting a connection.

## Echo Server

An echo server receives a message from a client and sends the same message back to the client. This example introduces reading from and writing to sockets.

## Multi-Client Server

A more advanced example where the server can handle multiple clients at the same time. This is achieved using threading or asynchronous programming.
